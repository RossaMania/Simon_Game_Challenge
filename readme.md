## Simon Game Challenge

This is my version of the Simon Game Challenge from "The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp", available on Udemy.

This project comes from Section 15: Boss Level Challenge 2 - The Simon Game, and features JavaScript and jQuery.

This is one of the first projects I ever did with Javascript and jQuery.

This wasn't just a "code-along" or exact copy of the challenge materials. I took this challenge and was able to add my own personal touches. These personal touches include: changing the text color to a nice bright white, adding a nice purple text shadow to text, and making the button highlight purple.
